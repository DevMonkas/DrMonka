## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Dr.Monka is a mobile app which promotes teleconsulting . The app includes features like -

- User Profile Creation -
  A patient enters their name, address, sex, age, medical history and other vital data needed to start the treatment process to build a profile.

- Book an appointment -
  A user can see a list of doctors, view their profiles, and book an appointment that lasts for 24hrs.

- Video conferencing -
  Patients use this feature when they need a doctor to examine them. Doctors conduct initial observations through video chat, which is why the quality of video is so critical. Proper diagnosis and therapeutic accuracy rely on good connection and clear picture.

- Voice-only calls -
  Most people don‚Äôt want to reveal their faces when it comes to psychological issues, and like to speak private. The App provides a voice-only call feature for these purposes. It offers a safe forum for people who feel reluctant to get trained assistance to speak about their issues.

- Built-in chat -
  A patient can use the secure built-in chat to contact a doctor with any urgent query, to get a second consultation, or if they have any questions concerning prescribed medications.

- Payment gateway -
  After the consultation, a patients pays the doctor for the service provided. To achieve this, we have integrated Razorpay payment gateway via API which can accept all major credit/debit cards and even UPI payments.

- Push notifications (WIP) -
  Push notifications are your primary way of communicating with your users. Alert users of upcoming appointments or meetings, alert success transactions and incoming messages and advertise your services.

- Ratings and reviews (WIP) -
  Once the patient has received medical treatment from a doctor a patient can rate the doctor and leave a review. This feature helps new patients make better decisions while finding doctors.
